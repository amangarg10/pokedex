I have not tested sites before; normally I just play around with them. I did some research 
and learned that Jest and React Test Library provide pretty comprehensive testing. 

I would run the following tests. 
1) Check 10 randomly chosen Pokemon appear on the list of Pokemon by checking that the Pokemons name appears in the document
1b) Click on the Pokemons name for each of the 10 Pokemon and ensure that the details page contains the Pokemons name 
2) Use the search feature and ensure the same 10 appear when searched
2b) Click on the Pokemons name for each of the 10 Pokemon after searching and ensure that the details page contains the Pokemons name
